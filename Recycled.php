                <p>Recycled yarn is created through the process of recovering articles from PET plastic for reuse or recovering its raw materials for production. Recycled polyester is just as good as virgin polyester but takes less resources to make - Recycled polyester is almost the same as virgin polyester in terms of quality, but its production requires 59 percent less energy compared to virgin polyester.</p>
                <p>Recycled polyester, often called rPet, is made from recycled plastic bottles. It is a great way to divert plastic from our landfills. The production of recycled polyester requires far fewer resources than that of new fibers and generates fewer CO2 emissions.</p>

        <p class="para2" id="para2">Fabric, made from recycled plastic doesn't mean that it is stiff and uncomfortable. The fabric is just as soft and resilient as non-recycled polyesters. Recycled polyester, often called rPet, is made from recycled plastic bottles. It is a great way to divert plastic from our landfills. The production of recycled polyester requires far fewer resources than that of new fibers and generates fewer CO2 emissions.</p>
        <p class="para2">Between 45% and 70%</p>
        <p class="para2">less CO2 emissions generated during rPet production compared to virgin polyester</p>
        <p class="para2">60% less energy</p>
        <p class="para2">Is required to produce rPet compared to virgin polyester</p>
        <p class="para2">There are 2 ways to recycle polyester: For mechanical recycling, plastic is melted to make new yarn. This process can only be done a few times before the fiber loses its quality. Chemical recycling involves breaking down plastic molecules and reforming them into yarn. This process maintains the quality of the original fiber and allows the material to be recycled infinitely, but it is more expensive.</p>
